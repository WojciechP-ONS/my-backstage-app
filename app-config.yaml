    ### Example for how to add your GitHub Enterprise instance using the API:
    # - host: ghe.example.net
    #   apiBaseUrl: https://ghe.example.net/api/v3
    #   token: ${GHE_TOKEN}

proxy:
  '/circleci/api':
    target: https://circleci.com/api/v1.1
    headers:
      Circle-Token: ${CIRCLECI_AUTH_TOKEN}  ### Example for how to add a proxy endpoint for the frontend.
  ### A typical reason to do this is to handle HTTPS and CORS for internal services.

  #   '/test':
  #     target: 'https://example.com'
